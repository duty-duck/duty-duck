title: Command Line Tool
---

We provide a command line tool to interact with the Duty Duck platform, particularly to simplify the execution of tasks to monitor. The tool is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS operating systems.

## Getting the Tool

You can download the binary for your operating system and architecture:

- [From GitHub](https://github.com/duty-duck/duty-duck/releases)
- [From AWS S3, in our public bucket](https://releases-s3.dutyduck.net)

You need to download the binary corresponding to your operating system and architecture, and add the binary to your PATH.

### Example for Linux:

```bash
# Download the binary to /usr/local/bin directory
curl -L https://github.com/duty-duck/duty-duck/releases/download/cli%2Fv0.0.1/linux-amd64-dutyduck -o /usr/local/bin/dutyduck

# Make the binary executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dutyduck

# Verify that the binary is executable
dutyduck help
```

## Usage

You can get help on all available commands with `dutyduck help`.

```bash
Usage: dutyduck <COMMAND>

Commands:
  config  Configuration related commands
  user    User related commands
  tasks   Tasks related commands
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Authentication

To use the tool, you'll need to authenticate using an API token. You can obtain an API token from the dashboard on the "My Account" page.

[More information about API tokens](/docs/developers)

Once you have obtained an API token, you can use the `dutyduck config set` command:

1. `dutyduck config set api_token_id <YOUR TOKEN ID>`
2. `dutyduck config set api_token_secret_key <YOUR TOKEN SECRET KEY>`

You can verify that the authentication is working with the `dutyduck user get` command, which should return your user information.
