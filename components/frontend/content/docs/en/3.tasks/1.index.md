Duty Duck's Tasks feature allows you to monitor the proper execution of your critical processes, such as data backups, and react quickly in case of delays or failures.

This feature enables you to monitor the proper execution of individual tasks or recurring tasks (Cron Jobs). We can detect various failure scenarios for you, such as:
- An expected task started late
- An expected task wasn't executed at all
- A task failed and stopped
- A task didn't stop as expected

This monitoring is essential for several reasons:

1. **Business Continuity**: Backups and other automated tasks are crucial for your business continuity. A missed backup can result in irreversible data loss.

2. **Early Problem Detection**: Monitoring helps quickly identify execution failures and allows intervention before a minor issue becomes critical. For example,
the feature can be used to regularly monitor available disk space on your servers and alert you in case of issues.

3. **Compliance and Audit**: In many sectors, it's necessary to prove that backups are performed regularly for regulatory compliance reasons.

4. **Resource Optimization**: Monitoring ensures that tasks run within expected timeframes and don't conflict with other processes. An alert
can be sent to your team if a task starts late or runs longer than expected.

### Possible Use Cases

- Monitoring the proper execution of your database backups
- Regularly checking available disk space on your servers
- Verifying the successful delivery of your periodic emails, such as sales reports
